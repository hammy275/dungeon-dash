# DungeonDash

A Temple Run-esque Minecraft plugin that allows you to build your own map/path/dungeon, and have a chaser chase players to the finish!

## Current Features

* Map creation, editing, and saving.
* Player joining, playing, and leaving
* Map customization, including:
  * Whether water respawns the player
  * Whether the void respawns the player
  * If respawns should kill players
  * Whether players should be chased or if the first to the finish is the winner
  * Checkpoints (just place golden pressure plates!)
* Permissions support!
  * Check out the top of [this file](https://github.com/hammy3502/dungeon-dash/blob/master/src/net/blf02/dungeondash/utils/PermissionChecker.java) for all supported permissions!
